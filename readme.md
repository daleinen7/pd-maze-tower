# The Maze Tower Playdate

A reinterpretation of the [original](https://github.com/jscarpelli3/Jon-Scarpelli_The-Maze-Tower) for Playdate

## Run Locally

To run this game you will need the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/)

If you use Mac and zsh (like me) add `export PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH=/Users/<username>/Developer/PlaydateSDK` to your .zshrc file
